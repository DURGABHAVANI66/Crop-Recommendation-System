 # Libraries 
Imported the necessary libraries for doing the project 
Each library helps in following ways 
## Numpy (numpy as np):

A powerful numerical computing library used for working with arrays, matrices, and performing mathematical operations.
## Pandas (pandas as pd):

A data manipulation and analysis library that provides data structures like DataFrames for handling tabular data.
## Matplotlib (matplotlib.pyplot as plt):

A plotting library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
## Scipy (from scipy import stats and from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency):

A library used for scientific and technical computing. The stats module contains a large number of probability distributions and statistical functions.
chi2_contingency: Performs the Chi-squared test of independence.
# Statsmodels (import statsmodels.api as sm and from statsmodels.formula.api import ols):

A library for estimating and testing statistical models.
## sm: The main namespace for the library.
## ols: Used for Ordinary Least Squares regression.
## Scipy again (from scipy.stats import f_oneway):

f_oneway: Performs one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance).
## Seaborn (import seaborn as sns):

A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
## Math (import math):

Provides access to mathematical functions like square root, trigonometry, logarithms, etc.
## Scikit-learn (from sklearn.cluster import KMeans and from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture):

A machine learning library for Python.
## KMeans: A clustering algorithm that partitions data into K clusters.
GaussianMixture: Implements Gaussian Mixture Models for clustering.
Matplotlib again (import matplotlib.pyplot as plt):

This is a duplicate import and not necessary since it's already imported above.
## Scikit-learn again (from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler):

MinMaxScaler: A preprocessing technique to scale features to a given range, typically between 0 and 1.
